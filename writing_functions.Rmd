```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
```

## Do something simple

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)##computes a z-score
```

I want a function to compute z-scores

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {

 if(!is.numeric(x)) {
   stop("Input must be numeric")
 }
   
 if(length(x) < 3) {
   stop("Must have at least three numbers")
 }
  
 z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}

z_scores(x_vec)
```

Try my function on some other things. These should give errors!

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_scores(3)
z_scores("my name is matt")
z_scores(mtcars)
z_scores(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
```
